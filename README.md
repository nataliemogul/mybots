Generating the body includes a starter cube with a randomized size. Then, a direction will randomly be chosen (x,y,z) for another cube to "grow from" the original cube. This cube will be a different randomized size. This process will be repeated a random n number of times.

For the brain" motor and sensor neurons are assigned randomly and there is no defined fitness function currently.

A diagram of how the body contructs itself can be seen here:
